# blog-api

This API was created using NodeJS and Express. It serves two different frontends:
1. The Admin Frontend (https://github.com/ThomYorke7/blog-admin), where the admin can perform CRUD operations on the blog posts, as well as deleting comments;
2. The User Frontend (https://github.com/ThomYorke7/blog-frontend), where users can read posts and leave comments.
